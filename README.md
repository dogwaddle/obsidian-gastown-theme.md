## Note to Visitors (08/20/2021)

This theme has effectively been abandoned because I've been working on maintaing the primary theme I use called Lizardmen Zettelkasten (see my github page). If you like this theme a lot and want to see it continued, feel free to fix up whatever parts you'd like to and make a pull request.

# Gastown for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
